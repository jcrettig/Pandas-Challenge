As detailed in the jupyter data report, we looked at the detail for trends in the city’s schools.  Our data had the following attributes:

Total Number of Schools: 15
Total number of Students: 39,170
Total combined budgets: $24,649,428

Overall results for the city are as follows:

Average math scores: 78.99%
Average reading scores: 81.88%
Percent passing math: 74.98% - passing = 70% or better 
Percent passing reading: 85.81% - passing = 70% or better 
Percent overall passing: 65.17% - passed both math and reading

Items of note from our analysis:

With regards to average spending per student, there appears to be an inverse relationship between spending and average scores and passing rates.  

With regards to school size, medium sized schools (1000 - 2000 student) tend to have overall higher average scores and passing percentages. Small schools (less than 1000 students) have slightly lower scores and passing percentages than medium schools.  Large schools (greater than 2000 students) overall had significantly lower scores and passing percentages than small and medium schools.  

Overall charter schools had higher average scores and higher passing percentages than district schools.  

The top 5 overall performing schools (average percent overall passing) were all charter schools.

The bottom 5 overall performing schools (average percent overall passing) were all district schools
